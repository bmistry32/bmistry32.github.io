            subtext="In modern-day society, we are surrounded by data, most of which is too long and laborious for the everyday person to read comprehensively. With the art of generating extractive summaries becoming increasingly trivial, the challenge of producing abstractive summaries that can understand and convey the meaning of a document remains prominent within the field of natural language processing. Although summarisation is a task that humans can easily complete, developing automated approaches that can generalise well with different data formats remains a challenge. Despite a recent surge in research to improve abstractive summarisation methods, there are still outstanding problems regarding the validity of generated summaries. The method proposed experiments with combining extractive and abstractive summarisation methods, to evaluate whether extractive methods can be effective in driving more human-like abstractive summaries. The overall aims and evaluators are the reduction of repetition, and the improvement of precision, recall and human-judged grammatical correctness."

Reducing acquisition time using under-sampling acceleration rates (4 fold and 8 fold masks), helps to mitigate these issues, however, this comes at the const of reconstructed image quality."
            subtext="The project aimed to improve the viability of the more efficient under-sampling strategy by designing a system that maximises the quality of under-sampled reconstructions. High-quality reconstructions are images that closely align with the ground truth, the fully-sampled image. SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) is used to evaluate the success of the model's output against the ground truth image.
            The model implemented was a U-Net, with RMSprop as an optimizer."

This extends to those seeking places to stay on holiday or a completely new place to live. A K Nearest Neighbours Classifier was trained on the data, and used to classify the rating of each different neighbourhood in Berlin, where a rating higher than 80% represented a 'good' area. Areas could then be classified based on their latitude and longitude, giving an overall view of the city, as shown in the above picture.
